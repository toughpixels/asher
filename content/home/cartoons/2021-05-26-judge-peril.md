alt: "Three judges sit in a booth, one holds up a sign with a score: 78. The second hold up a score: 81. The third holds up a sign saying: I accidentally tripped the judge in the bathroom and killed him. I panicked, put on his clothes, and here I am. I am so scared. It's crazy how one day can change your life."
