One of them says "I want to do one of those fun fantasies where we go to a hotel bar and pretend to be strangers, and you try to pick me up, but I think you're disgusting and run away with the bartender, who is very strong and not at all like you, and the strong bartender and I start a new life together and I never see you again."
