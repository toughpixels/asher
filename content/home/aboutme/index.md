## About Me

Hi! I am an [Emmy-nominated](https://www.emmys.com/bios/asher-perlman) comedian, writer, actor, cartoonist, and hyphen-hunting multi-hyphenate. I am currently a writer for [The Late Show with Stephen Colbert](https://www.cbs.com/shows/the-late-show-with-stephen-colbert/), a contributing cartoonist at [The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/), and a performer with [The Improvised Shakespeare Company](http://www.improvisedshakespeare.com/). I also perform all around New York City as [myself](https://www.ashermaxperlman.com/). My award-winning short film, [“Accountabilibuddies,”](https://vimeo.com/334507378) was an official selection at the 2019 [Just For Laughs Film Festival](https://www.hahaha.com/) in Vancouver, and I’ve had two pilots premiere at the [New York Television Festival](https://www.nytvf.com/), one of which went on to become an original series on the the women-centric streaming platform, [Pypo](https://www.pypo.com/).

I developed my comedy chops in Chicago, where I performed with [The Second City](https://www.secondcity.com/), both on its touring company as well as one of its residence stages. I also performed at the Chicago Just For Laughs Festival, iO, The Annoyance, ComedySportz, and approximately one thousand [bars](https://www.google.com/search?q=bars+near+me).

On television, I have appeared on [Comedy Central](https://www.cc.com/), [Pop TV](https://www.poptv.com/), and several national commercials, including one for Sprint where I was a 30-year-old man with a 15-year-old daughter. Whenever I think about it, I gasp.

Before The Late Show, I was a staff writer for [The Opposition with Jordan Klepper](https://www.cc.com/shows/the-opposition-with-jordan-klepper). I’ve also written for [The Onion Labs](https://twitter.com/onionlabs?lang=en) and [McSweeney’s](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/).

Please keep scrolling and thanks for being here. The 2018 Ron Perlman movie, “Asher,” totally tanked my search results, so arriving at this page is a genuine achievement.
